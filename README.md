# retryable-demo

This repo provides an example of using the Spring Retry framework
to retry failed operations in a Kotlin application automatically. 
The demo includes a simple service that makes HTTP requests to a mock 
server and demonstrates how to configure Spring Retry to retry failed 
requests with a fixed backoff interval.
